### Primary Colours

Primary colours are the base colours of the UI, the ones that are used most
frequently in the interface. **Brand-01 is the base branding colour**,
corresponding to WFP’s corporate blue: it is used for brand elements and
non-interactive elements. **Interactive colours** are used for primary
links and action items that can be clicked or touched, to emphasize important
actions and highlight information in your application. 


<ColourList filter="brand" />

<Colour color="brand-01" />
<h4 className="wfp--story__sub-heading">WFP's corporate colour</h4>

The brand-01 colour is WFP’s corporate blue which is used in all
(non-interactive) branding elements. It is the colour displayed most
frequently across your App’s screens and components. The primary colour
can also be used to accent elements.

#### Use brand-01 for:

- ✓ MainNavigation
- ✓ brand elements
- ✓ dark background

#### Do not use for:

- ✗ interactive elements like buttons or links
- ✗ Primary and secondary colours

<Colour color="interactive-01" />

<h4 className="wfp--story__sub-heading">
  Primary interactive colour, primary buttons
</h4>

Used for primary links and action elements that can be clicked or touched. It
is slightly lighter then the main WFP blue to communicate that an element is
interactive and to be distinguishable from black.

<img
  alt="Brand colour"
  style={{
    width: '100%',
    height: 'auto',
    marginTop: '1em',
    marginLeft: '0em',
  }}
  src={`${process.env.STORYBOOK_INTERNAL_ASSETS}internal/brand-color.png`}
/>

<Colour color="interactive-02" />
<h4 className="wfp--story__sub-heading">
  Interactive emphasis colour (e.g. hovers)
</h4>

This colour is used for hover and active states.

#### Use interactive - 01 for:

- ✓ links
- ✓ buttons
- ✓ other interactive elements

#### Do not use for:

- ✗ MainNavigation, since it is a branding element and not interactive as a whole.
- ✗ other branding elements
- ✗ non - interactive elements


#### Secondary colours are best for:

- ✓ floating action buttons (mobile devices)
- ✓ progress bars
- ✓ important highlights
- ✓ call-to-action buttons and links
- ✓ yellow makes a good button colour in placed in isolation
- ✓ external websites where colour creates interest and meaning and
  improves the conversion rate

#### Do not use it:

- ✗ for regular actions
- ✗ multiple actions / times on the same webpage
- ✗ limit the use of yellow to the elements you want to emphasize
  related to the audience priority
- ✗ limit usage for texts and navigation elements

### Extended primary palette

This palette extends the primary palette by providing lighter and darker
tints of the WFP brand colour. They can be used to increase the contrast
of the UI elements to make them more or less visible compared to the
rest of the interface.

<ColourList filter="brand-extended" />

### Neutral Colors

Neutral colours are used for non-interactive elements, backgrounds,
borders and texts.

<ColourList filter="ui" />

### ui-01 and ui-02

<h4 className="wfp--story__sub-heading">
  Container and page background colors
</h4>

**ui-01** is used as the page background if there are not Modules on
top of it, while ui-02 is used as the page background when there are
Modules on top.

<img
  alt="Brand colour"
  style={{
    width: '100%',
    height: 'auto',
    marginTop: '3em',
    marginLeft: '0em',
  }}
  src={`${process.env.STORYBOOK_INTERNAL_ASSETS}internal/background-contrast.png`}
/>

### Data visualisation palettes

#### Sequential palette #1 (default)

<ColourList filter="sequential-default" />

#### Sequential palette #2 (secondary)

<ColourList filter="sequential-secondary" />

#### Categorical palette

<ColourList filter="categorical" />

### Semantic colours

<ColourList filter="support" />

<Colour color="support-01" />

Use the error colour to indicate an error or to focus the attention on something
which is crucial to see. Paired with a cross icon, red delivers the message that
something went wrong.

<Colour color="support-02" />

Use green to indicate success state. Paired with a checkmark icon the user
knows that the operation was successfully completed.

<Colour color="support-03" />

Use yellow to indicate a transient warning which is less important than an
error message. Yellow typically consists of items which require the user’s
immediate attention, or indicate a waiting period. Although this overlaps with
the use of red, yellow is more transient in nature.

### Symbolic colours

<ColourList filter="symbolic" />

### Usage

The colours can be used via JavaScript or different frameworks.

#### Usage in JavaScript

```jsx
// Import colours as json (needs a json loader)
import colors from 'cdema_uikit/src/globals/data/colors.json';

// Import colours as js
import colors from 'cdema_uikit/src/globals/data/colors.js';

const barChartColor = colors.navy;
```

Setting colour variables makes it easy to reuse colours, without the hassle of updating every single Hex colour code once they change.

#### Usage in scss

```css
// Only use variables
@import '~cdema_uikit/src/globals/scss/vars';

body {
  background: var(--ui-02);
}
```
